Taking a fun tactic implemented in class, and making it public for further refinement and generalization, and for implementation in other frameworks.

The original course with more information is [here](https://dependenttyp.es/classes/fa2022/artifacts/12-custom.html).

To compile the Ltac version, you will need [StructTact](https://github.com/uwplse/StructTact).

This is mostly retired as of June 28th, and has moved into the [Rosetta Stone](https://github.com/coq-community/metaprogramming-rosetta-stone) project repository.
